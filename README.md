PicuDrugs
=========

a drug calculator for infusions and bolus doses of medications in critically ill children with database back end, and centile calculations to minimise the chance of weight errors (particularly the 10 fold errors common in paediatrics)

for examples of a running version, see http://www.paediatricdrugs.net/ and enter data

please note you will also need to use the stats for age project, in a seperate repository at:
https://github.com/mcshaz/BlowTrial/tree/master/StatsForAge

A web.config file is not included in this solution in order to hide sensitive information, but I will edit out connection strings and machine keys and then put push it to this repository if requested by any interested parties.
